expense-manager
=====================

A minimal application that combines [MobX](https://mobxjs.github.io/mobx) with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).
Supports ES6 and JSX compilation through babel.
The idea was simply to play a bit around with React and Mobx. It's not as great as it should be, but it's just a coding playground.

### Run the example

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
